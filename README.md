# Father Klingot
Ironic prophetic twitter bot that relies on bad translation and AI completion text

Father Klingot started off a discord bot with the same purpose.

It's very simple to use it, just reply to a tweet tagging it following the word "scramble" or "notscramble" and the bot will reply to you.

- <b>scramble - </b> translates the tweet replied to through 10 different languages, sending out the result in English, in order to create an incomprehensible version of the first tweet.

- <b>notscramble - </b> runs the tweet replied to on the text completion AI from deepAI.org and sends it.
